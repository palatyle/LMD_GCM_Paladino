This is a set of scripts designed to plot GCM files using NCL graphics.
=======================================================================
First version: january 2012, S. Lebonnois

Remarks:
--------

- Requires NCL to be installed on your system.

- Your simulation file need time, pressure, lon and lat dimensions. 
The names of the dimensions matter, so you may get an error message if yours are not supported. Just let me know and we'll get this fixed.

- The second variable only gives contours on the 2D maps. 
Not yet implemented for 1D nor for projections.
Needs additional options to customize... 

- Hopefully this script will improve with time.

visu-ncl
--------

- copy the "visu-ncl" bash script to you bin directory 

- modify this copy so that the NCLDIR environment variable correctly point to the UTIL/NCL directory

- when you are in your simulation directory, do :
   visu-ncl -h |more             : list of available options
   visu-ncl -f <yoursimu>.nc     : list of variables in <yoursimu>.nc

If you get errors or think of additional features that could be useful, let me know, I'll be happy to improve the script for wider use when possible.
