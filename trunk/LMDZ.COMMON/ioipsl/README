Scripts in this directory are illustrative examples of how to
obtain and install IOIPSL:
1) install_ioipsl_gnome.bash: everything is set for Gnome, just run:
./install_ioipsl_gnome.bash
And output modules and library will be in subdirectory 'modipsl/lib'

2) install_ioipsl_gfortran.bash and install_ioipsl_pgf90.bash are more
general examples for installing IOIPSL on a machine with either compiler.
Note that the paths to the NetCDF library hard coded in the scripts 
will surely need to be adapted to your local settings.
Then simply execute the script; output modules
and library will be in subdirectory 'modipsl/lib'

Note that it is a good idea to install IOIPSL outside of the LMDZ tree
so that its version can be tracked (and potentialy updated), as it is
downloaded from a different svn repository.
