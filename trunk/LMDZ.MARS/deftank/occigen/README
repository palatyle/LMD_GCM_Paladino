>> EXAMPLES FOR OCCIGEN CLUSTER
Job "run_month1" runs a simulation for month #1 and then possibly launches
a job "run_month2" which runs a simulation for month #2 which then possibly
launches a job "run_month3" etc.
The starting and ending months of the simulation can be set in "run_month1"
One should adapt the script (and underlying "run0" and "run.def.ref") to
match their needs.
