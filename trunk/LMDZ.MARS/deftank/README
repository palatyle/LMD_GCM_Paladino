>> GENERAL INFORMATION
This directory contains examples of "def" files that are inputs for GCM runs,
along with sample scripts to run the model (in serial, on a Linux system).
Subdirectories ciclad, occigen, etc. contain scripts specific to these
machines and their job schedulers; check the README there.

>> DEF FILES
To run the GCM needs (see documentation) "run.def", "callphys.def",
"traceur.def" and "z2sig.def" input files.
Files stored here are suffixed for different "GCM configurations"
(e.g. *.def.watercycle to run simulations with the dust and water
cycles); rename (and adapt) them for your usage.
Miscelaneous comments:
- run.def.1d is an example specific for the 1D testphys1d model
- run.def.lonxlatxalt illustrate cases for different spatial grids
  (typically the GCM is run at 64x48 horizontal resolution)
- z2sig.def is the current standard vertical grid definition (use 54 layers
  if running up to ~100km, e.g. water & dust cycle simulations, 73 layers
  if including chemistry and thermosphere up to ~300km)
- *.MCD5 files correspond to what was used to generate MCDv5.x simulations 

>> XML FILES
These are required when running with the XIOS library
- iodef.xml : general settings
- context_lmdz_physics.xml : definition of variables, grids, output files, etc.

>> SCRIPTS
- "run0" is a script to run (once or nummax times) chained simulations
- "run_mcd" is a script that uses "run0" and runs simulations taking
  into account the change of number of sols every Martian month.
