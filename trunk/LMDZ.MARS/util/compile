# The following script can be used to compile one of the utilities
# program. Example of use :
# > compile concat
# > compile zrecast

# pgf90 -Bstatic   $1.F90 \
#-I/distrib/local/netcdf/pgi_7.1-6_32/include \
#-L/distrib/local/netcdf/pgi_7.1-6_32/lib -lnetcdf  -o $1.e

#ifort $1.F90 \
#pgf90 $1.F90 \
ifort $1.F90 \
-I$NETCDF/include \
-L$NETCDF/lib -lnetcdf -o $1.e

# Before running that on you computer you might want to change :
# 1) replace "pgf90" with the name of your favorite compiler 
#    (you may also add some non-agressive optimization options e.g. -O2)
# 2) replace "/distrib/local/netcdf/pgi_7.1-6_32/lib" with the
# address of the
# directory that contains the NetCDF library (file libnetcdf.a that can
# be obtained for free on
# http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html
# (see user manual)
#
# 3) Replace "/distrib/local/netcdf/pgi_7.1-6_32/lib" with the address of the
# directory that contains the NetCDF  include file "netcdf.inc"
# that can be obtained at the web address above.
# 
# 4) The "-Bstatic" option is here to ensure that the executable will
# work on any Linux machine (only necessary if you want to export the
# executable from a machine to another).
