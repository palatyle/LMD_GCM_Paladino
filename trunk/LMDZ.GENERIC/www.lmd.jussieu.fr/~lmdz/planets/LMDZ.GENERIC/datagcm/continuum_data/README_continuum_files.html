H2O_CONT_NU.dat / H2O_CONT_SELF.dat / H2O_CONT_FOREIGN.dat  --> WAVENUMBER for the SELF and FOREIGN water vapour (far-wings) continuum (H2O-H2O and H2O-air).
Comes from CKD2.4 ? This continuum works for H2O lines cut at 25cm-1 (PEDESTAL IS INCLUDED IN CKD/MT_CKD !!)

H2-H2_ramirez2014sp.dat --> H2-H2 continuum taken from Ramirez et al. 2014 supplementary materials.

CO2-H2_ramirez2014sp.dat --> H2-CO2 continuum taken from Ramirez et al. 2014 supplementary materials. This continuum is based on HITRAN H2-air database.

CO2-CH4_wordsworth2017.dat --> CO2-CH4 CIA continuum calculated in Wordsworth et al. 2017.

CO2-H2_wordsworth2017.dat --> CO2-H2 CIA continuum calculated in Wordsworth et al. 2017.

H2-air_HITRAN.dat --> H2-air continuum taken from HITRAN database.

CO2-CO2_CIA_HITRAN.dat --> CO2 CIA absorption (from HITRAN, based on Gruszka and Borysow 1998)

CO2-CO2_CIA_HITRAN_0-1000cm-1.dat --> CO2 CIA absorption. Same than CO2-CO2_CIA_HITRAN.dat but extrapolated (log extrapolation) from 250 to 1000cm-1. Source: Martin Turbet.

CO2_dimer_data.dat --> CO2 dimer absorption (from Baranov et al. 2004)

CO2-CO2_CIA_Stefani_2500-3500cm-1.dat --> CO2 CIA absorption in the 2500-3500cm-1 region, based on the experiments of Stefani et al. 2013.
Digitized and extrapolated (log-extrapolation) by Martin Turbet.

H2O-CO2_CONT_MaTipping92.dat --> H2O-CO2 continuum (far-wings) calculated at different temperatures by Q. Ma. 
This continuum works for H2O lines cut at 25cm-1 (PEDESTAL IS INCLUDED IN CKD/MT_CKD !!)

H2O-H2O_MT_CKD3.0.dat -->  MT_CKD 3.0 H2O self continuum calculated by Martin Turbet using the MT_CKD tool (http://rtweb.aer.com/continuum_frame.html)
