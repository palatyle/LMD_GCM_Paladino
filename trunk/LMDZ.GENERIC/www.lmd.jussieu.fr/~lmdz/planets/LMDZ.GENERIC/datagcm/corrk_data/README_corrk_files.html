CO2_H2Ovar --> correlated-k coefficients initially used in Wordsworth et al. 2013 Icarus to simulate the atmosphere of early Mars. Designed to simulate a CO2-dominated atmosphere, with H2O as a variable species (H2O mixing ratio < 10%, total pressure < 100bar, temperature < 400K).

(H2O self and foreign far wing absorption --> not included)

Earth_110-710K --> initially used in Leconte et al. 2013 Nature to simulate the atmosphere of Earth entering in runaway greenhouse. Designed to simulate the atmosphere of the Earth (N2-dominated + 376ppm of CO2) with H2O as a variable species (H2O mixing ratio up to 100%, temperature up to 710K).

(H2O self and foreign far wing absorption --> not included)

megaCO2 --> designed to simulate a pure CO2 atmosphere.

early_earth_CO2_0.01_CH4_2e-3 / early_earth_CO2_0.1_CH4_2e-3 / early_earth_CO2_9e-4_CH4_9e-4 --> initially used in Charnay et al. 2014 JGR paper. Designed to simulate a N2-dominated atmosphere with CO2 and CH4 mixing ratio fixed (as in the name of the folders), with H2O as a variable species. Corresponds to cas A, B and C in Charnay et al. 2014 JGR paper.

(H2O self and foreign far wing absorption --> not included)

present_day_Venus --> designed to simulate the atmosphere of present-day Venus. No variable gas. These coefficients were built by Martin Turbet and SÃ©bastien Lebonnois to simulate present-day Venus with the generic model. Note that the coefficients are valid only for the temperature/pressure conditions along present-day Venus thermal profile.

Venus_H2Ovar_extreme_16g_with_cont --> designed to simulate the atmosphere of Venus with variable H2O. Source: Martin Turbet. (not been validated yet). All continua are included in the spectra.

CO2_H2Ovar_extreme_16g_with_cont --> designed to simulate a thick CO2+H2O atmosphere were both gases can become dominant. Source: Martin Turbet. Used in Pluriel et al. 2019 Icarus (magma ocean planets), as well as Turbet et al. 2019 Icarus (to simulate the effect of very large impacts on early Mars). All continua are included in the spectra.

CO2_SO2step_H2Ovar --> designed to simulate a thick CO2 atmosphere with various concentrations of SO2, and H2O as a variable species. Used by Laura Kerber to simulate volcanism on early Mars (source: Kerber et al. 2015 Icarus)
