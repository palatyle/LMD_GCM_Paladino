!! summary: Interfaces module for external functions
!! author: J. Burgalat
!! date: 2013-2015,2017

MODULE MM_INTERFACES
  !! Interfaces to external functions.
  !! 
  !! The module contains the definitions of all "external" functions used by moments model which are 
  !! left to the developer's responsibility. 
  !!
  !! # Functions 
  !!
  !! - [[mm_interfaces(module):mm_alpha_s(interface)]] should compute the inter-moments relation coefficient 
  !!   as a function of the moment's order for the spherical mode.
  !! - [[mm_interfaces(module):mm_alpha_f(interface)]] should perform the same computations as 
  !!   [[mm_interfaces(module):mm_alpha_s(interface)]] but for the fractal mode.
  !! - [[mm_interfaces(module):mm_ps2s(interface)]] should compute the probability for particles of the 
  !!   spherical mode to remain in that mode during coagulation process.
  !! - [[mm_interfaces(module):mm_qmean(interface)]] should compute the mean eletric charge correction to be 
  !!   applied on each coagulation sub-kernels computed in mm_haze module.
  !! - [[mm_interfaces(module):mm_get_btk(interface)]] should compute the \(b_{k}^{T}\) coefficient of the
  !!   free-molecular regime.
