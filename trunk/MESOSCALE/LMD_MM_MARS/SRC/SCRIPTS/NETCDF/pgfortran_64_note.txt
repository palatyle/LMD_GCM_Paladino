Linux, Portland Group version 6 compilers

For netCDF version 3.6.1, Jason Elsom reports that he needed to use -mcmodel=medium flags when compiling a netCDF client program with pgf90 for a 64-bit target platform using version 6 PGI compilers, in order to access more than 2 GB of memory. In addition, he compiled the netCDF library with -fpic -Mlarge_arrays "to avoid an inconsistent addressing problem". Here are the specific environment variables he used to build the netCDF libraries:

CC		= pgcc
CXX		= pgCC
FC		= pgf90
F90		= pgf90
CFLAGS		= -O2 -Msignextend -fpic -Mlarge_arrays
CXXFLAGS	= -fpic -Mlarge_arrays
FFLAGS		= -O2 -w  -fpic -Mlarge_arrays
F90FLAGS	= -O2 -w -fpic -Mlarge_arrays
