# Use:    
#
# makemeso                   ## basic use (real-case configuration)
#
# makemeso -d                ## no compilation, just check the name of the compile folder
#
# makemeso -c ideal          ## idealized mode (convective cell, mountain wave, etc...)
# makemeso -c les            ## large-eddy simulations mode based on WRFV3
#
# makemeso -n                ## do not recompile LMD physics (must have been compiled before)
#
# makemeso < last            ## basic use + skip questions [! script must have been executed at least once]
# makemeso -r < last         ## basic use + skip questions + only known config
# makemeso -nr < last        ## basic use + skip questions + only known config + no LMD phys recompile
#
# makemeso -j                ## just compile the LMD physics
#
# makemeso -g                ## debug mode
#
# makemeso -h                ## display options
#
# makemeso -p                ## with new LMD physics
#
# makemeso -f                ## fresh start [clean -a]
#
# makemeso -s storm          ## a specific scenario, you need a corresponding mars_lmd_... (only for newphys)
#
# makemeso -x                ## a case with no LMD physics included
